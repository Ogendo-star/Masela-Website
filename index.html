        <h1>Hi, I'm Ogendo</h1>
        <h4>A Software Engineer</h4>
        <p>Believe me when I tell you that nothing is a coincidence. 
        Each and every occurrence in our lives is actually predestined and unfolds flawlessly as time elapses. 
        Moringa School is a dream come true for me. I had really wished to join Moringa School in my early years, 
        lo and behold! it was probably not the best time.
        I am truly grateful for the chance that I have been given.
    I am a multi-talented,hardworking lady who runs a fish business, sells household goods,
does freelance photography on the side while still being a fully fledged Front office admin.
I am a mother to three amazing babies who I am truly proud of, I can never miss an opportunity to mention them; 
they are gift from God for me. I am tempted at times to associate my hardwork to them but deep down, I know I do it for my sanity.
As the Gen Z's put it, "It is my thing."
